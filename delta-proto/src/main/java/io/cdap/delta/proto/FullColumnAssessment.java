 * Column assessment containing information from both the source and target. Types are system specific type names.
 * For example, when reading from a database, the source type should be a type familiar to users of those databases.
 * Similarly, the target type should be a type familiar to users of that target system.
 * Column names in the source and target may also differ, either because of a user specified transformation, or because
 * the source name had to be normalized because the target system has a different supported character set.
